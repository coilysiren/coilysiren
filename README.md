I'm Kai, a DevOps engineer with a decade of industry experience. I'm 66% dev (mostly Python) and 33% ops (mostly AWS). I have working experience writing in 6 programming languages - Python, Golang, and NodeJS being the strongest. I'm familiar with deploying to AWS, GCP, and Azure - and multi-cloud setups between them.
